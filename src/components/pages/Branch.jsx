            <h1>Little Lemon</h1>
            <h2>Chicago</h2>
            <p>
            Little Lemon is a restaurant founded by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, 
            who moved to the United States with the shared dream of owning and operating their 
            own dining establishment. Their passion for food and hospitality inspired them to bring
             a taste of their Italian heritage to a new audience. <br /><br />
            Mario, an experienced chef with a deep connection to traditional 
            Italian cuisine, carefully curates the menu using cherished family recipes and 
            techniques he mastered in Italy. His dedication to authenticity ensures that each 
            dish reflects the rich culinary traditions of their homeland.<br /><br />
            Adrian, on the other hand, focuses on the business and marketing aspects of
             the restaurant. He has been instrumental in growing Little Lemonâ€™s presence,
              attracting a diverse customer base, and ensuring the restaurant remains a local 
              favorite. Recognizing the evolving tastes of their patrons, he also led the initiative 
              to expand the menu beyond classic Italian fare, introducing a variety of Mediterranean-inspired 
              dishes. This addition allows Little Lemon to offer a more diverse and exciting dining experience 
              while staying true to its roots.
